analysis — cluster-side processing pipeline for MaxwellABP parameter sweeps.

Public API:
    PsweepCollector  — read-only navigator over a sweep directory.
    ProcessedSweep   — reader for per-analysis `<name>.h5` reduced outputs.
    register_analysis — decorator that registers an analysis with the framework.
    get_analysis, list_analyses — registry lookup.
